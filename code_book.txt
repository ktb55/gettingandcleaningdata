Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this data set come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (time-BodyAcceleration-XYZaxis and time-GravityAcceleration-XYZaxis) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (time-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-XYZaxis and timeBodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-XYZaxis). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (time-BodyAcceleration-Magnitude, time-GravityAcceleration-Magnitude, time-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-Magnitude, time-BodyAngularVelocity-Magnitude, time-BodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-Magnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency-BodyAcceleration-XYZaxis, frequency-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-XYZaxis, frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-XYZaxis, frequency-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-Magnitude, frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-Magnitude, frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-Magnitude. (Note the 'frequency' prefix to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZaxis' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
standardDeviation: Standard deviation value

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. From this variables (subjectIdentifier and activity) were attributed to each reading to denote which subject performed which activity

subjectIdentifier
activity

The average of each feature was calculated based on the subjectIdentifier and grouped by the activity.

Average-time-BodyAcceleration-XYZaxis
Average-time-GravityAcceleration-XYZaxis
Average-time-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-XYZaxis
Average-time-BodyAngularVelocity-XYZaxis
Average-time-BodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-XYZaxis
Average-time-BodyAcceleration-Magnitude
Average-time-GravityAcceleration-Magnitude
Average-time-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-Magnitude
Average-time-BodyAngularVelocity-Magnitude
Average-time-BodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-Magnitude
Average-frequency-BodyAcceleration-XYZaxis
Average-frequency-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-XYZaxis
Average-frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-XYZaxis
Average-frequency-BodyAcceleration-Magnitude
Average-frequency-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-Magnitude
Average-frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-Magnitude
Average-frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-Magnitude

The average of each feature was calculated based solely on the subjectIdentifier and added to the data set as a new row with the activity value set to "ALL".
