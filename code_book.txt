Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (time-BodyAcceleration-XYZaxis and time-GravityAcceleration-XYZaxis) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (time-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-XYZaxis and timeBodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-XYZaxis). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (time-BodyAcceleration-Magnitude, time-GravityAcceleration-Magnitude, time-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-Magnitude, time-BodyAngularVelocity-Magnitude, time-BodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-Magnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency-BodyAcceleration-XYZaxis, frequency-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-XYZaxis, frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-XYZaxis, frequency-BodyAcceleration-Jerk-Magnitude, frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-Magnitude, frequency-BodyAngularVelocity-Jerk-Magnitude. (Note the 'frequency' prefix to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZaxis' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
